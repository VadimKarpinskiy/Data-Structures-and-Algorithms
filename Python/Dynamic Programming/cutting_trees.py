# Given an array representing forest. We gain money for every tree cut, but if we cut the tree that has index i, we
# cannot cut trees with indexes i-1 and i+1. Write an algorithm to find the max value we can get cutting trees in the
# forest.

# f(i) - maksymalny zysk zciÄ™cia do i-tego drzewa

# f(i) = max (f(i-2) + value[i], f(i-1))
